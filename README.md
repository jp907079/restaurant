# restaurant

When working at a restaurant, the job of the host is to check in customers and also create a wait list. 

In this program, we want to create the following resources:
  - class "party", with the attributes party size, arrival time
  - function waitTime to calculate how long a customer has been waiting
  - function estimatedTime to calculate how long a customer will wait for a table if queue is full
  - be able queue and enqueue customers from wait list and current list
  - if party size > table size, add the two tables together to seat the party
  - TBA
